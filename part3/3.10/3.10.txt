I chose to improve Monopoly card generator's image size and security. 
Before the improvements, the Dockerfile uses default python image and uses root user. The size of the image is 911MB.

After migrating to alpine version of python, the size has decreased to 49.8MB. Also, the root user is no longer running the app, rather a newly created one.
I had to change the file permissions after user change.

Dockerfile before (size 911mb):

FROM python:3.10

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

CMD python3 generator.py

Dockerfile After (size 49.8mb):

FROM python:3.10-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN chmod 777 generator.py && \
    chmod 744 community_chest.csv && \
    chmod 744 chance.csv && \
    adduser -D appuser && \
    chown appuser . 

USER appuser

CMD python3 generator.py
